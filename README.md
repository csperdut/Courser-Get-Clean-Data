The run_analysis.R script answer to the five questions of the exercise.
After loading and unzipping the data file, there are the following phases

phase 1: to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
to do that, the code reads the training and testing data, merging them into tidy data sets

Phase 2: to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
read the featured labels and, after assigning friendly names, search for mean and sd inside the features vector

Phase 3: descriptive activity names in the data set 
Phase 4: is designed to label the data with descriptive activity names
